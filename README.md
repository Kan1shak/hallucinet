# HalluciNet

A unique search engine simulation that generates a dynamic, interconnected artificial internet. Each search query creates its own reality, with results being preserved and expanded upon in subsequent searches.

*Explore an ever-evolving web of AI-generated content where every link leads to a new generated webpage.*

## Features

- **Dynamic Search Results**: Every search generates unique, contextually relevant results that become part of the simulated internet
- **Recursive Page Generation**: Clicking on search results generates full webpages, with any links on those pages also being dynamically generated when accessed
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Compatible with various LLMs including:
  - Anthropic's Claude
  - OpenAI's GPT-4
  - Google's Gemini
  - Local LLMs through Ollama (e.g., Llama)
- **Efficient Caching**: Redis-based storage system reduces repeated search times from seconds to milliseconds
- **Native SDK Integration**: Direct integration with LLM providers' SDKs for optimal performance

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Redis
- Any supported LLM API access (Claude/GPT-4/Gemini/Ollama)
